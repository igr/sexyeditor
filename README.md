# Success Stories

Over time, we have received a large amount of beautiful feedback on how `Awesome Editor` changed people lives. Here are just a few.

> "I was just a junior developer in this high-end, enterprise, company. No one really listened to my ideas, they just delegated the most boring tasks to me. Until one day, the principal consultant saw my IntelliJ IDEA opened. He came to my place and asked about the plugin... and a month later, I was promoted and started working directly for the consultant. Guys, thank you so much." — Greg, New York, USA

> "I had a huge crush on our new internship guy. I put his image as a background, I was really in love. One day he saw his image beyond my Java code. He liked both the code and the plugin. Year later, we got our first kid. He was named Ed, in honor of Awesome Editor." — Jacqueline, Paris, France

> "I stopped smoking thanks to you guys! I spent like hundreds of dollars for all kind of California therapists, and nothing helped. I was despaired. Then I just made a pic with a simple sentence: I am not smoking. That was it. I guess my brain processed this message even if I was not directly looking at it. Two months later, I was a new guy!" — Brian, San Francisco, USA

> "Everyone in my office wants to figure out the secret of how I made my IDEA so beautiful. I am not telling them, ha ha... And I love this feeling!" — Anonymous
