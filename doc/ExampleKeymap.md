# SexyEditor example: IDEA Keymap

Since right part of the editor is often unused, user can add
image with most important keymaps to it:

For example, user can take default IDEA keymap reference,
and create an image for each column. Than it can put these images
in the file list and turn on the slideshow.

Think: you can use images with custom text and sublimate messages!
