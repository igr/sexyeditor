# Awesome Editor Examples

ðŸš€ Just few ideas to start you up!

## Backgrounds Gallery

Add all your preferred images to the `file list` and activate the `slideshow` feature. Perfect for individuals who spend long hours on IDEA. Have fun!

Turn off the `slideshow` if it becomes too distracting; just enable the `random` flag instead: every time the new file is edited, a random background will be used.

(In the example: images are aligned to middle-right edge and opacity is set to 20%.)

## Background per file type

Have each file type its own background! For example, we can put little Duke in bottom-right corner for all Java files (`*.java`):

![](duke.jpg)

(In this example the Duke image is a PNG image with transparent background. Therefore, `opacity` of the image may be high, e.g. 80% - 100%.)

## IDEA Keymap

Since the right part of the editor is often unused, we can add image with most important keymaps to it:

![](keymap.jpg)

For example, we can take default IDEA keymap reference and export an image for each column. Put these images in the `file list` and turn on the `slideshow`.
