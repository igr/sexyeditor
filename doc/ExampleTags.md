# SexyEditor example: Types

One usage scenario is to tag file types with images. For example,
user can put little Duke in bottom-right corner for all java files:

![](duke.jpg)

Note that in this example Duke image is a PNG image with
transparent area around the Dukes figure. Therefore, opacity
of the image may be set to be high, e.g. 80% - 100%.
